# PhishWatch

Phishing Site Detection using custom Algorithm.

## Introduction

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information. This is a serious threat to the security of the user and the organization. 

## Problem Statement

The problem statement is to implement an algorithm to identify potential Phishing Sites

## Solution

The solution is to implement an Algorithm to identify potential Phishing Sites. The algorithm is implemented using the following steps:

- [x] Check is site is using HTTPS
- [x] Check if the URL is not a 404
- [ ] Check if the domain is blacklisted
- [ ] Check if the domain is using a free hosting service
- [x] Check if the domain name is registered for more than a year
- [x] Check if the domain has a valid DNS record
- [x] Check if the domain is using a URL shortening service
- [x] Check if the domain is using a website forwarding service
- [x] Check if the domain has valid SSL certificates
- [x] Check if the domain has a favicon
- [x] Check if the domain is using a missing HTTP Secure Headers
